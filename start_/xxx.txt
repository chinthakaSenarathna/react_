--------------- 	React 	     -------------------

-> reatc is JavaScript Library...
-> allows you to create SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION(SPA)...
	-> index.html

-> node_module -> all our project dependency
	       -> any library installed in this folder, before we used				


-> index.html -> all react code inject to the index.html
	-> <div id="root"></div>

-> App.js -> already created component(default)

-> main.js/index.js -> all react component MOUNTING them to the DOM
		    -> all react component Renering them to the DOM
