Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique,
where you attach a SINGLE EVENT HANDLER TO A PARENT ELEMENT to handle event on its CHILD ELEMENTS.

------------------------ React --------------------------------------


-- 01 Virtual DOM VS Real DOM ??? ---> Reconciliation ???

Virtual DOM is lightweight of the Real DOM...
When data changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM.
React then compares this new Virtual DOM with the previous one (from the last render)
The process of comparing and updating the Real DOM based on the differences between the two Virtual DOMs is called reconciliation.
Only the changed parts of the Virtual DOM are updated in the Real DOM, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.



-- 02 useState VS useRef ???
